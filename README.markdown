 - hogs

  Hogs displays some of the processes you'll see in `ps aux` if it thinks
  they're slowing down the system. This is particularly good on the desktop,
  doesn't work so well on a server.


 - flash-to-vlc

  This will look at any flash videos loaded in recent versions of chrome
  and open them in VLC. Maybe it also works with firefox, who knows. :)
